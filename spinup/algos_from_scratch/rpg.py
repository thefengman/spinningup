"""
This will be an implementation of the REINFORCE policy gradient algorithm (RPG), the most basic (no-frills) policy
gradient method. Note that it will not have the improvements used by Spinning Up's VPG, which are (1) estimating V,
for evaluating advantage, and (2) using return-to-go rather than the full return. We use the version of REINFORCE
discussed in UC Berkeley's CS 285 (Deep RL) course.
